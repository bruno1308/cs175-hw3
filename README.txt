By default, the IP is set to localhost (127.0.0.1), since I live in a place where I couldn't forward ports to test via Internet.

Game 1 - Fly Tapper
	A random number (1~12) will show up in the screen, pretend that each of the buttons numbered from 
1 to 12 is a fly and press (kill) the right button as soon as you can.
	This exercise was used during the chinese war to train the speed of the soldiers.

Game 2 - Slider Master
	A random number (0 ~ 100) will show up in the screen, pretend the seekBar is a sword and swing the
control to the number you see. Be careful though, because if you move it too fast, you move won't be smooth enough and it won't count,
practice your accuracy with your speed.
	So far, only japanese samurais were able to master this art.

Game 3 - Typer Master
	A sequence of chars will show up in the screen, and you have to copy it in the EditText as soon as you can!!!
	Powerful exercise for the thumbs, used during the french revolution to pierce enemies with the thumb!!!
